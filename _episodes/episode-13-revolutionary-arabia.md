title: "Episode 13: Revolutionary Arabia "
description: "“Revolutionary Arabia” chronicles the armed left-wing
  revolutionary movements that challenged British imperial power across Southern
  Arabia, from the National Liberation front seizing power in South Yemen to the
  Dhufari revolutionaries in Oman waging a liberation war against the British
  and the sultan. While today’s alliance of reactionary Gulf monarchies seems
  inevitable, here we see they were made by colonial power–and that they were
  seriously contested by revolutionary movements in the 1960s and 1970s. "

discussionQuestions:
  - question: What was the relationship between local conservative power and
      far-flung imperial power? Why was the former so dependent on the latter
  - question: Why were the struggles against monarchies in the Gulf so belated and
      slow compared to the struggles against the Hashemites in the core of the
      Mashriq?
  - question: "Why did these armed struggles turn to armed resistance? "
  - question: "How did these revolutionaries relate to other radical currents in the
      region? "
  - question: "Why were they ultimately defeated? "
