  then its explosion after the Arab defeat in the June War of 1967 with the
  Israeli colonial state. Fateh, the Popular Front for Liberation and Palestine,
  and other factions launched an armed guerilla struggle, engaging the
  Palestinian people in a full-scale mobilization for their liberation. Also:
  Ba’athists Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein seized power in Iraq, as did
  Muammar Gaddafi’s Free Officers in Libya. "

discussionQuestions:
  - question: "Meaning of revolution: the Palestinian revolution for Abed is for him
      not reducible to the overthrow or replacement of a regime, so much as the
      development of a struggle — which takes multiple forms and undergoes
      countless mutations — against Zionism, imperialism, and other local
      reactionary forces. What are the political stakes of talking about
      revolution in this way? "
  - question: "What were the major strategic and political faultlines for the
      Palestinian left in this period–what, for instance, differentiated Fatah
      from the PFLP or the DFLP? Do these strategic dilemmas feel similar to you
      or distant from contemporary concerns in your local context? Or for the
      region today? "
  - question: "How would you appraise the political character of this next
      generation of junior officer coups that roil the region: al-Bakr, Hussain,
      Gaddafi. Ultimately progressive, revanchist, or something else entirely? "
  - question: "What does their emergence signal about the shape of radical mass
      politics in the region at the time? "
