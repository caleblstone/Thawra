title: "Episode 12: Origins of Saudi Reaction "
description: "Abdel and Dan anatomize Saudi Arabia, a country whose reactionary,
  US-aligned trajectory was throughout the 1950s and 60s challenged by labor
  strikes, dissident currents, rebellious princes, and an anticolonial oil
  minister. But, eventually, Saudi royal conservatism won out, and was exported
  across the region. "

discussionQuestions:
  - question: "The episode opens with an anatomy of power in Saudi Arabia: it
      presents two ways of understanding the country – one where the prime
      driver is a theological and religious leadership, and another which says
      that power resides with a royal family with its own dynastic dynamics.
      Which does Abed say is a more compelling understanding of power in the
      Kingdom? "
  - question: "What are the key features and tensions of royal, dynastic power? "
  - question: "What were the connections between top level politics and grassroots
      radicalism detailed in this episode? "
  - question: Why did the conservatives win out?
  - question: Today, these gulf monarchies are some of the main drivers of
      ravanchism in the region and world – RFS, Libya, the humanitarian
      catastrophe in Yemen, etc – what makes them so powerful as actors and why
      are their interests tilting in the way they do
  - question: How should we theorize and understand the Gulf powers - as capital’s
      emirates, as a regional powerhouse, or agents of the American empire?
      Which seems most apt to you, based on what you learned in this episode?
