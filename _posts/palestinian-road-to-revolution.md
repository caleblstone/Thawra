title: "Palestinian Road to Revolution "
description: " “Palestine on the Road to Revolution” covers the creation of a
  Palestinian national liberation movement throughout the 1950s by a people
  dispersed by the Nakba: organizations, alliances, and theories of change
  assembled in the universities, cities, and refugee camps surrounding
  Palestine. We end with the 1958/59 foundation of Fateh, an organization that
  eventually became the largest in the Palestinian political system, primarily
  focusing on the idea of launching an armed revolution as the pathway to
  liberating Palestine. This is the story of the beginning of the Palestinian
  national liberation movement as we have come to know it today."

discussionQuestions:
  - question: "This moment is the explosion of radical and mass-politically oriented
      ideologies. What were the broad historical conditions of possibility for
      the founding of ideologies like Movement of Arab Nationalists, and their
      spread?  "
  - question: What were key regional hubs for the development and spread of that
      ideology? Why did these places become important sites of ideological and
      political development?
  - question: "What are the essential features of the Movement of Arab Nationalists
      ideology, and what makes it different from the Ba’ath, or the communists?
      What is the theory of the separation of stages? What sort of political
      alliances would such a theory prescribe? "
  - question: What are the concrete political practices of groups like these at this
      moment? What are the kinds of alliances they seek out and develop most
      vigorously?
