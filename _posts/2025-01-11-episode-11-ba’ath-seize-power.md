title: "Episode 11: Ba’ath Seize Power "
description: "This episode recounts the destruction of the two giant
  revolutionary projects of 1958: the union of Egypt and Syria under Nasser’s
  United Arab Republic and Iraq’s July Revolution that brought Qasim alongside
  communist allies to power. The rival radical projects of pan-Arabism and
  communism suffered huge blows. The Ba’ath also transform in this period, from
  an ideological movement to a party dominated by military men who want to turn
  the organization into an instrument of raw domination. "

discussionQuestions:
  - question: "The Ba’ath party underwent a series of transformations in this
      period, from a dissident intellectual movement to a party wedded to Syrian
      state power. What changes in the course of these transformations and where
      does that leave Ba’ath ideology by the end of this episode? What social
      forces or institutional arrangements produce this outcome? "
  - question: "The Communists in Iraq were torn between a break with Qassim and a
      rallying around him against reactionary forces. Why did either side take
      the position that it did? Does this dilemma feel familiar in other
      political contexts? "
  - question: Frequently sectarian explanations are brought out as the beginning and
      end of political analysis of the region. What reasons does Abed share in
      this episode for its explanatory limits?
  - question: "Through competitor projects, this progressive Iraq and the United
      Arab Republic explode spectacularly around the same time. What larger
      historical currents contributed to their undoing? What challenges does
      this suggest for any emancipator project across the region? "
