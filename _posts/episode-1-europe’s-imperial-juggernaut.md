title: "Episode 1: Europe’s Imperial Juggernaut"
description: "The first episode of our series establishes the development of
  European imperialism in the Arab world from the late 18th through early 20th
  centuries, the rise of constitutionalist movements  that challenged
  monarchical absolutism, and the emergence of early labor and land reform
  movements. These processes shaped all political thought and action, affecting
  revolutionaries as well as restorationists across the region. "

discussionQuestions:
  - question: What were the early forms and expressions of European imperialism in
      the late Ottoman period?
  - question: What were the primary forms that resistance took at the start of
      European imperialism in the region?
  - question: "Early in the show, Abed argues that an intellectual and political
      history would by itself be insufficient to grasp the trajectory of Arab
      radicalism in the modern era, but would have to also grasp the development
      of various social forces within the region. What do you think about this
      method and approach? "
  - question: If you apply it to our conjuncture today, how would you describe the
      forces shaping and feeding into the development of Palestine solidarity
      movements?
  - question: What was the class landscape of this era as discussed in this episode?
      What were the dominant modes of labor, exploitation, production – and how
      did that shape the sort of political expression of resistance?
