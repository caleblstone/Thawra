discussionQuestions: ["What were the early forms and expressions of European imperialism in the late Ottoman period?", "What were the primary forms that resistance took at the start of European imperialism in the region?", "Early in the show, Abed argues that an intellectual and political history would by itself be insufficient to grasp the trajectory of Arab radicalism in the modern era, but would have to also grasp the development of various social forces within the region. What do you think about this method and approach?", "If you apply it to our conjuncture today, how would you describe the forces shaping and feeding into the development of Palestine solidarity movements?", "What was the class landscape of this era as discussed in this episode? What were the dominant modes of labor, exploitation, production – and how did that shape the sort of political expression of resistance?"]
