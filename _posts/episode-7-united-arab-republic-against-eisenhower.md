title: "Episode 7: United Arab Republic Against Eisenhower "
description: "We begin with the US’s Eisenhower Doctrine, which in 1957
  inaugurated a new era of imperialism in the Middle East, including the
  deployment of American combat operations in the region; and end with a local
  political response: the Ba’ath Party driving Syria and Egypt into the United
  Arab Republic, a superstate under Nasser’s rule, in 1958."

discussionQuestions:
  - question: "What was the Eisenhower Doctrine and how did it differ from the
      foreign policy prescriptions and impositions that preceded it? Where was
      this doctrine first developed and refined? "
  - question: "United Arab Republic: in what ways did it realize the old dream of
      pan-arab unity and what were the contradictions that resided within it?"
  - question: Why did the Ba’ath Party want to see the UAR come together? What did
      they imagine might happen? Did that political wager pay off?
  - question: How did the prior Communist-Ba’ath alliance come together and how did
      it fall apart?
  - question: "Abed spends some time describing the sectarian organization of the
      post-independence Lebanese state. What was it, and how was it complicated
      by the huge influx of Palestinian refugees into the country? And how do
      inflamed sectarian tensions and anti-Palestian sentiment produce a
      political crisis in 1958 that results in American marines landing on
      Lebanese shores? "
