      who led them, and what was the composition of the movement – both
      sociologically and politically?"
  - question: "The Great Revolts provided a political backdrop to the development of
      a range of modern ideologies: how is Abed the relationship between the
      great strikes and upheavals of the period and the intellectual currents
      that ran alongside them? "
  - question: "How would you describe the relationship between radical ideologies
      and contemporary movements today? "
  - question: "What else was happening in the world through 1936-1939: what are
      there parallels or points of divergence between these Great Revolts and
      the sit-down strikes in the United States, the Popular Fronts of Western
      Europe, the Spanish Civil War, and the long march through the Chinese
      countryside? "
  - question: "What were the similarities and what are the differences between the
      “ideological colorations” emerging in the wake of the Great Revolts: Arab
      nationalism, Islamic resistance, Ba’athism, and communism?"
  - question: "What made the new “ideological colorations” different from the
      patterns of resistance that preceded them? "
