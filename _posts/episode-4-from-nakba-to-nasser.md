discussionQuestions:
  - question: "The Nakba was a terrible tragedy for the Palestinian people, though
      it also had dramatic regional implications. How did the defeat of Arab
      armies by Zionist forces, and the subsequent displacement this entailed,
      reshape the politics of the region? "
  - question: "What is Abed’s account of the defeat of 1948: who bears the prime
      responsibility? "
  - question: "Nasser came to power in a junior officer coup in 1952. What were the
      crises within Egypt, and the region as a whole, that the coup was
      responding to. What answers did it provide or propose for these crises? "
  - question: "What were the mechanisms that tied local governments to British
      imperial interests in this period, in Iraq, Jordan and the other
      monarchies? "
  - question: "Nasser’s influence is not just domestic but regional, even global:
      what mistakes did other anti-systemic and revolutionary forces, such as
      the Communists, make that afforded Nasser so much room for maneuver? And
      why was there such a strong divide between anti-colonial nationalisms and
      communism? "
