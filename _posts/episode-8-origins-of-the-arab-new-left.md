title: "Episode 8: Origins of the Arab New Left "
description: This is a compact introduction to the Movement of Arab
  Nationalists, which in the 1950s built a presence that stretched across the
  region, from Beirut and Jordan to Cairo and the Gulf—becoming a truly powerful
  force in Kuwait. Led in significant part by Palestinians, its early history
  offers a ground-level look at the organizational and theoretical currents
  shaping radical Arab politics.

discussionQuestions:
  - question: "Who were the ideological and political mentors of the Movement of
      Arab Nationalists? What stamp did they put on the movement? "
  - question: What role or influence did 19th century European nationalism have on
      Arab new left?
  - question: "What was the basis of the political differences at this stage between
      the Movement of Arab Nationalists and the Ba’ath movement? How did this
      relationship evolve over the years? "
  - question: "The Movement of Arab Nationalists elaborated a theory of ‘three
      stages’ – what was this, and how did that define their political
      priorities and relationships with other elements of the Arab left such as
      the Communist Party? What do you think of this theory? "
  - question: "What accounts for the shift by the Movement of Arab Nationalists into
      becoming more left-wing, more socialistic in their politics? "
  - question: "How does the emergence of Nasser also change the sense of priority
      and mission for the Arab new left? "
  - question: "‘Vengeance’ is a signal concept in the early Movement of Arab
      Nationalists formation, though it later is subjected to some internal
      criticism. What did the concept denote, and what do you think of its place
      in an emancipatory political project?   "
