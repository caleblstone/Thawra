discussionQuestions:
  - question: "Scholars have increasingly discussed the Cold War not only as a
      globe-bestriding conflict between two ideologically opposed
      superpowers–the United States and the USSR–but also a struggle over the
      pace, content and form of the decolonization moment that was roaring
      across the globe at the same time. In what ways did the ‘Cold War’ play
      out in the Middle East and what was its impact, shape, and intentions over
      the pace and shape of the anti-colonial moment? "
  - question: What was the Baghdad pact? What future for the region did it propose?
      How did it differ, and how does it relate, to the prior operation of
      colonial power? What forces were coalescing in opposition to it?
  - question: "How was Nasser’s politics not just national but regional? And how was
      that regional message conveyed? What were the mechanisms that allowed it
      to travel? "
  - question: "Nasser lost the Suez campaign militarily but won politically. How?
      What does that suggest about politics? "
  - question: "How do these political developments in the Mashriq compare and
      contrast to the situation of French colonies in North Africa, or
      Indochina, or the stirrings of African independence in subsara? "
